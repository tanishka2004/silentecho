## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Lavender (#D3C0EB) to promote calmness and reflection.
- Background color: Light cream (#FFFFD1) for a soft, inviting feel. Using a less saturated hue keeps it from overwhelming the interface.
- Accent color: Mint (#A8E6CF) for interactive elements like buttons and sliders, providing a fresh and gentle contrast. Because mint is slightly more saturated and brighter than lavender, it pops, while keeping an analogous relationship with the primary color.
- Use ‘Patrick Hand’ for headers to give a personal, hand-written touch.
- Use ‘Open Sans’ for body text for its readability and clean appearance.
- Employ a set of custom mood icons, reflecting various emotional states. Make them cute and slightly rounded to match the journal's overall aesthetic.
- Subtle animations such as a heart-pulse on mood selection and sticker ‘pop’ when tapped will enhance the user experience.
